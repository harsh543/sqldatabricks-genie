Comprehensive instructions are critical to a seamless, intuitive Genie space experience. To enter instructions, click Instructions icon Instructions in the Genie space sidebar to open the instructions pane. Use this pane to add General instructions, Example SQL Queries, and SQL Functions.\n",
    "  - [General Instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/index.html#general-instructions): Provide plain text instructions that clearly convey your business or response preferences for Genie to follow. You can format the instructions as a single comprehensive note or categorize them by topics for better organization. For example: \"Our fiscal year starts in February\"\n",
    "  - [Example SQL Queries](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/index.html#example-sql-queries): are SQL queries that you prepare to help train Genie. When you add example queries, you are effectively showing Genie how to use your data to answer questions. You can also add example questions to teach Genie about the kinds of questions you would expect the example query to answer.\n",
    "  - [SQL Functions](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/index.html#sql-functions): are custom functions that are stored in Unity Catalog and used by Genie to answer specific questions that include complex arguments or calculations that Genie should not be able to access or edit \n",
